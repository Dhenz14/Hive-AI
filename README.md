# HiveAI Knowledge Refinery

## What is it?

HiveAI Knowledge Refinery is an AI-powered research system that autonomously discovers authoritative web sources, extracts structured knowledge into a persistent graph, generates polished "Golden Book" reference documents, and publishes them immutably to the Hive blockchain. It then distills this knowledge into LoRA adapters — compressed skill artifacts that encode the *ability to produce knowledge*, not just stored facts.

It operates fully offline with Ollama — no API keys required — while seamlessly scaling to high-performance configurations with async job queues, automatic hardware tuning, and incremental knowledge graph updates. The system features merge cycling (progressive LoRA training), MoLoRA domain routing, a secure code sandbox, and a Decentralized Brain Collective (DBC) for on-chain knowledge sharing.

### LoRA Training Pipeline
- **Self-Distillation** — 16 prompt templates generate training pairs from the model's own knowledge (standard + O1-style reasoning)
- **Claude Opus Distillation** — 5,500+ expert-curated training pairs across 996+ batch files covering 80+ technical domains (Python, TypeScript, React, CSS, DevOps, databases, security, ML/AI, system design, compilers, distributed systems, Hive blockchain, and more). Loaded dynamically via `scripts/claude_distill_v2.py`
- **Thinking-Trace Curriculum** — 1,638 thinking-trace training pairs with `<think>` blocks across 4 cognitive phases: Foundation (434 pairs: debugging, security, performance, architecture, testing, concurrency, data modeling), Advanced (401 pairs: backtracking, adversarial self-testing, analogical reasoning, tradeoffs, uncertainty), Meta-Cognition (403 pairs: reasoning quality, confidence calibration, Socratic method, learning from mistakes, code quality judgment), and Autonomy (400 pairs: training data generation, self-evaluation, curriculum design, meta-learning, autonomous improvement, quality assurance). Target mix: 72% direct-answer + 28% thinking-trace
- **Self-Improvement Pipeline** — Autonomous "get smarter" loop: self-eval → data generation → QLoRA training → GGUF export → validation. Includes LoRA bank, curriculum meta-learning, error-driven learning, and online distillation (p400-p407 batch series)

## Local-First Mode (No API Keys — Recommended)

HiveAI is designed to run fully locally on your own hardware. No cloud accounts, no API keys, no subscriptions.

### Setup Ollama

1. **Install Ollama**
   - **Windows**: Download from [ollama.com/download/windows](https://ollama.com/download/windows)
   - **macOS**: `brew install ollama` or download from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
   - **Linux**: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`

2. **Pull Models** (adjust based on your RAM — see sweet spot table below)
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen3:14b   # Reasoning model — sweet spot (32GB RAM)
   ollama pull qwen3:8b    # Fast model
   ```

3. **Configure HiveAI** (`.env`)
   ```ini
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///hiveai.db
   LLM_BACKEND=ollama
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
   OLLAMA_MODEL_REASONING=qwen3:14b
   OLLAMA_MODEL_FAST=qwen3:8b
   ```

4. **Start HiveAI**
   ```bash
   python -m hiveai.app
   ```

That's it — fully offline operation with zero API keys, zero cloud dependencies, and all data stays on your machine.

### Recommended Models by Hardware (Sweet Spot Guide)

The system uses two model tiers. The **reasoning model** does the heavy lifting — knowledge extraction (the actual gold mining) and book writing. The **fast model** handles lighter tasks like outlines, reviews, and summaries.

| RAM | Reasoning Model | Fast Model | Quality | Notes |
|-----|----------------|------------|---------|-------|
| 8 GB | `qwen3:4b` | `qwen3:1.7b` | Basic | Works but slower, less accurate extraction |
| 16 GB | `qwen3:8b` | `qwen3:4b` | Good | Solid quality for most topics |
| **32 GB** | **`qwen3:14b`** | **`qwen3:8b`** | **Sweet spot** | **Best quality-per-compute ratio (default)** |
| 64 GB+ | `qwen3:32b` | `qwen3:14b` | Diminishing returns | Marginally better, significantly slower |

Going beyond 32GB/14b is like panning for gold and getting mostly pebbles — the quality improvement per extra compute drops off sharply.

### Extraction Quality

By default, HiveAI uses the reasoning model for knowledge extraction (`EXTRACTION_QUALITY=high`). This means your strongest model does the actual fact-mining, which is where quality matters most. Set `EXTRACTION_QUALITY=standard` if you prefer faster processing with the lighter model.

### GPU Acceleration

Ollama automatically uses your GPU if available. NVIDIA GPUs with 8GB+ VRAM significantly speed up inference. No extra configuration needed — Ollama handles it automatically.

---

## Cloud Mode (OpenRouter — Optional)

For access to cutting-edge models like Qwen3-30B, Phi-4, Claude, etc. without local GPU:

### Setup OpenRouter

1. **Get API Key** — Create account and get key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

2. **Configure HiveAI** (`.env`)
   ```ini
   LLM_BACKEND=openrouter
   AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
   AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
   ```

3. **Optional Search APIs**
   ```ini
   SERPER_API_KEY=your-key-here
   BRAVE_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

---

## LoRA Training

HiveAI trains LoRA adapters that compress coding knowledge into lightweight model extensions. The pipeline supports multiple training versions, merge cycling, and domain-specialized models.

### Training in WSL2

LoRA training requires GPU access. On Windows, use WSL2 with an Ubuntu distro:

```bash
# Enter WSL2
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04

# Activate training environment
source /opt/hiveai-env/bin/activate
cd /opt/hiveai/project

# Prepare training data (loads all batch files + JSONL sources, deduplicates, curriculum-orders)
python scripts/prepare_v5_data.py --export --stats

# Train (Qwen2.5-Coder-14B QLoRA via Unsloth)
python scripts/train_v5.py --no-kl --force-unsloth 2>&1 | tee logs/train_v6.log
```

### Post-Training Deployment

After training completes, merge the LoRA adapter and export GGUF for llama-server:

```bash
# Deploy: merge LoRA + export GGUF (run in WSL)
python scripts/deploy_v6.py --quant q5_k_m

# Serve with llama-server + speculative decoding (run on Windows)
llama-server --model models/hiveai-v6/*.gguf \
  --model-draft models/qwen2.5-coder-0.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf \
  --port 11435 --n-gpu-layers 999 --ctx-size 8192 \
  --flash-attn on --cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q4_0

# Eval
python scripts/run_eval.py --model hiveai-v6 --base-url http://localhost:11435
```

### Continuous Improvement Loop

The one-command improvement cycle — train, deploy, eval, hunt weaknesses, prep next round:

```bash
# Full cycle (train → deploy → eval → hunt → prep)
python scripts/improve.py

# Check current loop status
python scripts/improve.py --status

# Skip training (adapter already exists), just deploy + eval + hunt
python scripts/improve.py --skip-train

# Analyze weaknesses from latest eval
python scripts/weakness_hunter.py

# Generate targeted pairs for weak categories
python scripts/weakness_hunter.py --generate --pairs 20
```

Each cycle identifies where the model is weakest and generates targeted training data to close those gaps. The model's weaknesses drive the next round of training, creating a self-improving feedback loop with no ceiling.

### Merge Cycling

Merge LoRA adapters into base weights to compound improvements across cycles:

```bash
# Merge adapter into base (Unsloth path for QLoRA)
python scripts/auto_cycle.py --adapter loras/v6 --deploy --eval

# View merge history
python scripts/auto_cycle.py --history
```

### Domain-Specialized Training

Train domain experts from filtered training data:

```bash
# See available domains
python scripts/train_domain.py --list

# Train Python specialist
python scripts/train_domain.py --domain python --dry-run

# Deploy domain model to Ollama
python scripts/deploy_domain.py --domain python
```

### MoLoRA Routing

Enable domain-based routing to automatically send queries to specialized models:

```ini
# In .env
MOLORA_ENABLED=true
MOLORA_DEFAULT_DOMAIN=general
```

When enabled, `smart_call()` classifies each query's domain (Python, Hive, JavaScript, Rust, etc.) and routes it to the matching specialized model. Falls back to the generalist model if a domain model isn't available.

### Eval System

Evaluate model quality with 165 coding challenges across 18 categories:

```bash
# Eval against Ollama model
python scripts/run_eval.py --model qwen3:14b

# Eval against llama-server (LoRA adapter)
python scripts/run_eval.py --model hiveai-v6 --base-url http://localhost:11435

# Parallel eval (3x faster)
python scripts/run_eval.py --model hiveai-v6 --base-url http://localhost:11435 --workers 3

# Compare with baseline
python scripts/run_eval.py --model hiveai-v6 --compare qwen3:14b
```

### Model Benchmark Harness

Benchmark coding models across 4 task categories with detailed performance metrics:

```bash
# Benchmark a single model
python -m bench.run_bench --model qwen2.5-coder:14b-q5_K_M

# Head-to-head comparison
python -m bench.run_bench --model qwen3.5:9b --compare qwen2.5-coder:14b-q5_K_M

# Speculative decoding via llama-server
python -m bench.run_bench --model qwen2.5-coder-14b --backend llama-server --draft qwen2.5-coder-1.5b

# Run specific category only
python -m bench.run_bench --model qwen3.5:9b --category single_shot debug
```

**Categories**: single-shot generation (5 tasks), refactoring (2), debugging (3), context retention (2)
**Metrics**: score, pass rate, tokens/sec, time-to-first-token, VRAM peak, speculative decoding acceptance rate

Results are saved as timestamped JSON in `bench/results/` for tracking improvements across training cycles.

| v7 | Qwen2.5-Coder-14B | Prep | 6,698 | — | v6 data + 995 new pairs, ready for next cycle |

#### Claude Opus Distillation Corpus

The project includes 5,500+ expert-curated training pairs distilled from Claude Opus 4.6, organized across 996+ batch files in `scripts/distill_batches/`. These break into two categories:

**Direct-Answer Pairs (~3,900+ pairs):** Cover 80+ domains including Python stdlib, async patterns, TypeScript, React, CSS, DevOps, databases, authentication, AI/ML (GRPO, DPO, RAG, multi-agent systems, speculative decoding, federated learning), system design, compilers, distributed systems, security, Hive blockchain (dhive, beem, custom_json, DeFi, NFTs, governance, node setup, indexing), algorithmic thinking (DP, graphs, trees, greedy, geometry), real-world debugging, code review/refactoring, and an autonomous self-improvement pipeline (p400-p407).

**Thinking-Trace Pairs (1,638 pairs):** A 4-phase cognitive curriculum teaching step-by-step reasoning via `<think>` blocks:
- **Phase 1 — Foundation (434 pairs):** Systematic debugging, security analysis, performance optimization, architecture design, code review, testing strategy, concurrency/distributed systems, data modeling/DevOps
- **Phase 2 — Advanced (401 pairs):** Backtracking & dead-end recovery, adversarial self-testing, analogical reasoning, multi-perspective analysis, first-principles reasoning, tradeoff analysis, uncertainty reasoning
- **Phase 3 — Meta-Cognition (403 pairs):** Reasoning quality evaluation, confidence calibration, Socratic method, context switching, learning from mistakes, code quality judgment
- **Phase 4 — Autonomy (400 pairs):** Training data generation, self-evaluation, curriculum design, meta-learning, autonomous improvement, quality assurance, integration

Target training mix: 72% direct-answer + 28% thinking-trace. The data bridge (`scripts/prepare_v5_data.py`) loads all sources, deduplicates, quality-filters, enforces the mix ratio, orders thinking pairs by curriculum phase (Foundation first, Autonomy last), interleaves them throughout direct-answer pairs, and exports as `v5.jsonl` ready for `train_v5.py`. See `scripts/distill_batches/THINKING_CURRICULUM.md` for the full curriculum plan.

## Usage Examples

### Create a Research Job

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "Quantum Machine Learning 2025"}'
```

### Batch Create Jobs

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/jobs/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "topics": [
      "Artificial General Intelligence",
      "Quantum Computing",
      "Biological Neural Networks"
    ]
  }'
```

### Monitor Queue

## Deployment

### Windows Desktop

```cmd
run.bat
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Production with Gunicorn (Linux)

```bash
export PRODUCTION=1
export WEB_WORKERS=4
python -m hiveai.app
```

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Database Setup

HiveAI supports both PostgreSQL and SQLite:

#### SQLite (Recommended for Desktop/Local)

SQLite is ideal for local development and desktop deployments with no server setup needed:

```bash
# Simply set the DATABASE_URL environment variable
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///hiveai.db
python -m hiveai.app
```

The database file (`hiveai.db`) is created automatically in the current directory.

#### PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)

For production deployments, use PostgreSQL with pgvector extension:

```bash
# Create database
createdb hiveai

# Enable pgvector
psql -d hiveai -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` to your PostgreSQL connection string:
- Local: `postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/hiveai`
- Neon: `postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/hiveai?sslmode=require`
- Supabase: `postgresql://postgres:pass@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres`

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Information Compression (complete)

The refinery: raw web pages → extracted triples → knowledge graph → Golden Books → Hive blockchain.

- [x] Web crawl → triple extraction → knowledge graph
- [x] Golden Book generation with quality scoring
- [x] Hive blockchain publishing with multipart splitting
- [x] Multi-hop RAG chat ("Ask the Keeper")
- [x] Secure code sandbox with chat self-verification

### Phase 2 — Skill Compression (current)

The trainer: accumulated knowledge → LoRA adapters that encode the *ability to produce knowledge*.

- [x] Self-distillation (16 templates, genetic expansion, scorer v5)
- [x] LoRA v1 training + eval harness (115 challenges, +15% over baseline)
- [x] Multi-backend LLM routing (Ollama + llama-server + OpenRouter)
- [x] Confidence routing via `smart_call()` (60-70% fast model usage)
- [x] Merge cycling (train → merge → repeat)
- [x] MoLoRA domain routing (Python, Hive, JS, Rust, C++, Go)
- [x] Claude Opus distillation corpus (4,500+ pairs across 560+ batch files, 80+ domains)
- [x] Thinking-trace curriculum (1,638 pairs, 4-phase cognitive training: foundation → advanced → meta → autonomy)
- [x] Self-improvement pipeline (p400-p407: autonomous "get smarter" training loop)
- [x] Model benchmark harness (12 tasks, 4 categories, speculative decoding metrics)
- [x] Training data bridge (prepare_v5_data.py: 6,698 curriculum-ordered pairs for Qwen 2.5 Coder)
- [x] LoRA v6 training (Qwen2.5-Coder-14B, QLoRA r=32, seq=4096, loss 0.31 — in progress)
- [x] Continuous improvement loop (improve.py: train → deploy → eval → hunt → prep → repeat)
- [x] Weakness hunter (weakness_hunter.py: eval-driven targeted pair generation)
- [x] Unsloth/llama-server merge cycling backend (merge_cycle.py updated)
- [ ] LoRA v6 eval + v7 training cycle
- [ ] Domain specialist training (per-domain LoRAs)
- [ ] GRPO+ reinforcement learning via rLLM

### Phase 3 — On-Chain Skill Storage (in progress)

Decentralized Brain Collective: knowledge and skills stored on Hive, reconstructible by anyone.

- [x] DBC protocol (on-chain pair proposals, HP-weighted voting, epoch consensus)
- [x] 3-backend chain abstraction (beem → direct RPC → lighthive)
- [x] Pair encoding (gzip + base64), secrets scanner, RC hysteresis
- [x] HivePoA adapter storage (IPFS + GitHub Releases fallback)
- [ ] Live deployment and testing on Hive testnet
- [ ] Multi-node federation and peer discovery
